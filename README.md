# Random-Quote-Generator
Part of Free Code Camps Front End Development Projects

Here is the link to the actual challenge: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine

- User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

- User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

Take Note: I didn't use a Quote API here since I didn't fully understand what the point of the project was.
I thought as long as I could get the data from some object, I was effectively accomplishing the objective of the challenge. I didn't understand how difficult it was to understand an API library and its documentation (which weird because I worked on a route/fare computing taxi app before for my mobile development class and used google maps api. But I was mostly following google's instruction then and didn't really understand javascript so yeah.)

So instead of looking for a site I can connect through and get data, I created my own JSON file with my own personal quotes and hosted it in my Public Dropbox folder. It's good enough since it still fulfills the User Stories anyway but I could've done better and learn more if took the harder route. Anyway I might re-do this in the future if I have the time. But so far I'm not really interested in doing so (Maybe if I need more practice or experience with RESTful APIs but then there's a lot of other sites I can use for that right?)
